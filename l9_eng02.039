^Sharp!
^f5a32633-7eec-4aeb-b47b-47694b9c0262
^That's supposed to be a sun.
^fc2834c4-4918-4c21-902c-40095987e333
^That looks like a moon.
^771a03e8-881e-4e1c-9745-d038b33e5d7f
^That leads deeper into the ruins.
^45a0e0b0-4866-481c-8b2f-9975e43f3363
^First there's that deep pit...
^fb9cc521-2d05-4e78-b1d6-8f1d5f9c10a0
^... then a hard stone pendulum...
^4f6c82c6-1049-454e-ba7f-36e42daa6173
^... then a merciless crushing ceiling trap...
^a9721bbd-447c-46e7-829d-86f1f294c0df
^... and finally a very sharp arrow trap.
^3aa906c7-b1e5-4bb1-a8c0-9c858f5bbba0
^Doesn't look like it'll open just like that.
^e4c96ab4-87c6-41a5-a10c-ccd46cc2148c
^It continues on that way...
^5d920393-f4d3-4614-befd-f46c41b09251
^At least this lever isn't quite as suspicious.
^579d0f58-1c3f-43f1-bc43-18e79be420a2
^There are a lot of suspicious symbol disks here.
^a2d7a8ca-6cf8-48ab-84fe-48d087c71e8c
^I don't understand the symbols.
^1a016e22-541a-464c-a5e8-08fc737ef41b
^Looks old.
^180a7b55-63e6-47cd-b80c-e79e784de521
^I found it! Now I just have to get inside...
^5d8c9b20-ad69-4bfd-87ce-e791f4b3236a
^It won’t open that easily.
^c4d433de-25d4-4eb5-937e-add54a5c27c2
^That's too high for me.
^d90c5c1d-7c2e-42e6-b6b8-f3883bba741a
^The Cave! The one with the Cosmic Cognition in it!
^f5175517-a92f-4912-92b1-7b80724fbd34
^Looks like it’s sealed.
^1b53cf21-d32a-4bba-b1af-83b14f201626
^There's a recess to put pieces in.
^81b31508-49c1-4347-aa7c-42a078f769d3
^The final frontier!
^7de1d0af-dadd-41aa-a946-f13319c7a78d
^Well, let's hope this works...
^044d9529-8200-4a49-9c84-61b699b79a3c
^I'm not putting my hand in there!
^2d5d71a9-3d15-43c5-b3a1-6efceb3e2c68
^I don't think I want to break that open.
^7f473ccb-b321-4445-9de9-6e6d4cfbfd4b
^I can't reach that.
^5cc20690-b627-45ef-96a2-ba4b1fdedad0
^I'm getting dizzy...
^5670b431-f0ed-4d11-b562-79d977e08f49
^It's some kind of alien device I don't know anything about. I should touch it.
^032e6768-4505-40ff-be79-09065beebf6b
^There's some strange little gnome in there.
^b7f27042-e555-4d23-ba38-56d6d9dd7479
^Somehow, I feel a kind of connection to the creature...
^979b2886-635e-4ea9-8a56-f49b3f9c9871
^There's some sort of complicated machine hanging up there, but I'll have to activate it first.
^ca409ae1-af99-48b0-823c-e9104f20719d
^This cave is REALLY big!
^3e589d9b-c0b4-4288-af8a-b4889d8ac522
^Time to get out of here.
^09dbab6d-8eb6-444f-b622-01959c6bb046
^Hmm... Do you think Wang uses this to launch nuclear missiles?
^75032019-c7ac-416c-b6ab-ebe7560742dd
^Or is it the self-destruct button?
^a818c4fe-183e-4da7-a00a-3c098966fee1
^What the hell, let's give it a try.
^08c0a577-5bf4-4fac-a474-f2e4abe00a3b
^Oh, it just started the computer.
^3f9bf46f-a312-40ed-8935-74631b6869ab
^The computer is already running.
^672e948e-a90e-424e-89bc-e9c9b8fae6bc
^I can't operate that from here.
^eb753744-663f-4984-a3a2-b788a246b2fe
^I'm no mechanic, but I don't think that can be fixed anymore.
^2cbeb36a-5323-4102-8b57-9ef596fbdbde
^I'm afraid even my ever-popular mouth-to-mouth resuscitation wouldn't help.
^dd2f774e-05f1-4c05-90db-82f966357b09
^In case I ever need to christen a ship...
^74e3969f-3aee-49e6-911c-0a8f3e558236
^I'll take the bottle out.
^75047e74-dae1-468f-b476-071d285fff6b
^It's empty.
^2493c4ba-3dbb-4a58-b9d3-65e8c7b20dea
^Heehee, my fingertips tickle when I touch it.
^f42eeba3-4d2c-4ce8-89a1-e53f787bd289
^I can’t get any of that on my fingertips. Or in my pants.
^a0009faa-5d3d-44ba-b47e-35e485815fc0
^That's the way down.
^8618c3ee-b2ec-48a8-99c5-f519bd6a1126
^Somehow I seem to see red buttons everywhere lately...
^004cccb0-4172-4182-a831-bdc2d5a4136c
^Hm... Looks like Wang has already planned a second version of the PiBot.
^430c4441-8943-4c7f-b13b-1882649934e1
^"Improved facial makeup."

^This copter’s rotor will never rotate again.
^5f54458d-659e-4f4a-8fa1-b9a3e9476111
^At least she knew what was coming.
^255cd50e-7300-439c-b083-33210583b533
^Is this Cerveza de los Champagneros?
^3ac56aea-c860-420f-9036-0861d4eb0a33
^Ah, the good old Barbarian Brew... now also available in a licensed mini fridge.
^5e6f2c7b-0245-4b99-8bdc-8c8cabf9a2fc
^This is a piece of the nucular engine.
^d0cc587c-b1ce-487b-944a-4e8455ddb605
^It's pretty squeezed out, but there's still a little left.
^a114c2ed-fe0f-42b4-b1dd-eacfc155275d
^I don't think they're listening to my orders.
^154e5284-22cf-4a86-94b4-a4397013b107
^I'm not touching that!
^8bcc05ec-5ae0-4bd4-94ef-b68e92a515fb
^Golden access cards make me feel really important.
^02382803-8af8-4da7-845f-22a320cf177b
^Good day to you too!
^d2a76147-02d3-46fa-b983-9d708d9a99ec
^This is not the time for robot sex.
^39358827-5426-4560-9c5d-8954f41787d1
^A sexy army. Horny but deadly.
^4ec8403a-8e59-4e8d-add9-3b038a9b5ead
^He chose... poorly.
^a3b86c55-29a8-465a-b136-a8c08624e268
^A golden access card. It'll probably open any door at Prune.
^33e650e7-5a33-4209-9a3f-59e04fdf08e5
^Looks pretty shriveled up, but otherwise intact.
^007804f5-d990-495d-9352-c23321912043
^Somehow I have to get Wang's PiBot to interface with our Virus Bot.
^e3e20812-6062-4d12-a1c9-8e651698cc84
^I have to make the Virus Bot even more attractive...
^831f19a9-daf5-4452-b514-b73a262070e4
^The copper wire is wound tightly.
^9fd3f77c-2c62-47b3-ada9-e9fc66403565
^Energy for more than just a hot night!
^b9d5e6c5-b2c8-4db0-89e0-f7044f51ba47
^Now those are attractive legs!

^Oral in the third degree!
^3913b8fb-1962-4689-8fd2-a08d01b40e8a
^Now he looks kind of... painted.

^No, that would be a waste of water.

^Lick-er!
^9e29725e-b432-4a89-981b-4bb144914285
^That's definitely too high.

^I don’t even want to touch that grinning mug, but there's nothing I can do about it.

^I like the hand a bit better this way.
^ca7167b6-0fbb-4a5d-8c36-ab40dbd52da6
^The PiBot loses a lot of value the second you open it!
^c2990e59-f883-45e1-8d13-5e4e7067b2d5
^Full to the brim and not a fish in sight.
^124cc836-7364-421c-a82c-884d7599bd97
^Replacement tongues. They wear out so fast when you know how to use them.
^2f477551-9242-4488-9b49-11a1078a391b
^I hate clowns.

^I hate clowns, even if they're deflated.
^a6bafbbf-145a-4f27-876b-7b528d4b2c11
^Small and wrinkly. Reminds me of my, uh, hamster.
^4a82f9f7-09ee-476f-9634-1074c84a76c1
^Looks almost alive.
^8de982bd-d68c-4d43-9b75-5e06c031614a
^New and sexy!
^d89f9dcf-fb51-4027-902d-5eeb2a240064

^The machine still isn't working... I think there's still something missing.
^43f77ef3-7323-4536-8962-ed7570b96891
^Now the Wallet is full to the brim.
^29efbe0c-253d-4ad8-9f18-3fd155d4f69b
^How did that go again? The blockchain has to be inserted here...
^f0033aac-924a-4d08-860b-199c101f1c57
^I'm not going to get far with this lock without a key.
^ad410915-f869-4767-b25c-78e8c2b9f4ae
^A brand-new, sturdy-looking lock.
^94ddbad6-5757-4628-bc57-2d5425e1ccdf
^Impossible to pick.
^8c9d21ad-25f3-4d56-a145-a2a90d9a4f05
^Looks like a hammock, but I shouldn't use it like one.
^027eb256-6018-4da4-b2f8-cf60b6801f46
^It's a good thing I know a lot about technology.
^e02f1f72-433b-447e-b0c6-f5b335ca27a0
^The Darknet looks shifty and sinister.
^6f02b8b2-f44d-4d4a-92fe-2c2ac012cf5d
^That must be the adapter we need.
^3cb764b3-49eb-436d-92a4-fa46f38ed8d4
^That's obviously for the Darknet.
^52df19b6-40a7-4f76-bef4-182742b2e8da
^I just need to use the terminal.
^1f159af4-e9b0-4726-9938-b76e96bbbd7a
^I know I shouldn't go in there, but we have to think more diversely!
^f0b72c5a-f5b2-468f-885a-524b46d348c3
^What, no comment, Pi?
^4970b66d-2f73-4e95-9f16-78882df2f520
^Oh... I forgot that she...
^85ce4c97-f406-4e6d-83ac-6bb059f1de35
^There's a sign missing.
^7d0e99e6-0597-4af1-aa39-b817004cb6d4
^That's obviously the ladies' room.
^a430f25b-1bc6-4fb2-bf78-1b89422036e4
^Oh, apparently this is the way to the ladies' room. That's a surprise.
^fe96024d-a48d-4aa1-8550-8e5eff9e11d1
^I'm not lying down in that!
^570519ac-f4dd-4219-b29c-26962a1ab427
^I can't open that thing while a program is running.
^a8eb2b3c-c715-4504-90e6-bb140eeffe65
^Please wait while the program is running.
^1f06132b-4a76-467c-b775-adb5cd43cb1c
^Nothing's happening.
^db8099e5-b5c7-4118-b708-b30fec7e4bea
^I can't reach it, it's in there.
^d6df4a93-fc1c-4b32-a0dc-b87234ac6c55
^A chainsaw that doesn't need gas. This changes everything!
^9406d62a-1166-4981-84e8-127b9fc6170d
^All bone, not even skin. Not my thing.
^27c64454-6abf-4b32-9d59-c435867e8acd
^No way in hell am I laying my arm on that thing!
^c0f9c1eb-252e-48ca-a422-0d084702b2f2
^Oh, "Doom Pérignon". And that is one big cork.
^7adc2adf-baaa-4eed-957d-65f2619e8eb7
^A bottle of “Doom Pérignon" with a needle in the cork.
^c78aaabe-9a21-40a6-826f-8d40d7dbc56f
^I always like to have spare body parts with me just in case.
^b632716c-273a-4a3b-b66c-f5f6ac5194e4
^Hmm, nice and warm now.
^ec10e634-ebac-49a5-8da6-d4bafe9c1f43
^Amazing, the way I keep finding cups full of a yellow liquid everywhere I go!
^8fca8095-057b-4ab1-b997-b8ebf986ec90
^I'm not exactly sure what it's for, but a person would fit in there.
^36fa747c-e29f-4e64-8e82-1c33d52323fa
^This thing's running a program right now.
^98438e89-f82e-4ed7-b43a-76460b67acb6
^Whatever that thing is, this obviously controls it.
^940499b4-5013-49a9-ba6e-e07b2688cee4
^The power's on.
^13e4c317-d67b-40b4-b0d9-94b2ca9eb4ff
^It's unplugged.
^02adc2ae-d66f-4028-b141-270f5b76e714
^Sharp and electric.
^36ac410f-a138-4964-b7a8-42b7f8183680
^I know why I'm not a big fan of diets.
^fe934c37-c34b-4ea6-8ee7-2b8bfed647b6
^That's where you have to put your arm to get treated.
^25d1d3cf-5183-414a-a566-1cca4ffa8cfe
^"Doom Pérignon". The bottle has a huge cork.
^a440964d-9635-451f-8009-1324aa97f911
^"Doom Pérignon". There's a needle in the cork.
^92583c99-3311-4110-a99a-efedb7f39463
^What slender ankles!
^87e30d7c-f40c-40e6-b790-938bd3570b73
^The liquid is now glowing a yellowish-green. How beautiful!
^486f8cd6-9db8-48d6-a0a7-0d4f51efbb2b
^A cup of yellow liquid.
^af689814-3ef0-4849-90b1-69e67994c43b
^I hope the cup doesn't tip over.
^280f04c4-c5fd-4a8d-b220-af6c31439789
^No, then the bottle will end up breaking in there.
^1542e971-e21a-4e3c-ac95-cae933c6620c
^I'm still traumatized by the coke bottle I left in the freezer.
^d7785c0f-0470-4b1d-ad9e-9ea96ec5d38a
^I'm sure that doesn't need treatment.
^44c6af08-52e2-4e4b-bf19-9545b30c4704
^“You will need to go through Tor to get into the Darknet.”
^568f1912-db3f-475a-922c-21547bdc00c9
^It’s spelled DOOR, not Tor!
^b9311f2b-285f-4741-9e73-6c3745d44856
^I can't just open it, I have to enter a code first.
^93984fdc-e54d-4376-96ff-507394b5a59a
^Hi! Hi! I sure hope I’m looking sharp!
^7e4b171f-c3d4-439c-8ddd-515cbe95916a
^The way into the submarine. Well, it would be, if the hatch were open.
^b6f77b4c-3e3a-4259-9418-665eae29bdc3
^That's the way down into the submarine.
^deb1cf7c-bb69-4815-afb3-a9a7c2f9ca87
^I think I can speak into this.
^f47b2b39-9adb-40d7-9d7a-100a6cb36eaa
^Hm... the camera on the buoy is pointed right at the door.
^5fc1054a-bd77-47dd-88d0-615625ea1fe5
^Isn't that Emma's flag?
^e31caa1a-0ef2-44b7-acab-62f777067511
^Maybe she saw something.
^a4813f9e-0f3d-4391-b586-e37108ad6de3
^I’d better leave the buoy alone.
^f6a13aa5-7a3c-4e5c-9ee8-740a67c8f04a
^I'll just move some things around...
^0065cb9c-60ad-4f8b-afed-62101e75f2e1
^No, I have to hide!
^cdbe29bb-cdc7-4dff-86f6-c67d41afaedb
^No! In the end, it'll explode!
^f1f6411c-5f5d-450b-be02-ed8e0ea3ca48
^Oh, a gun rack. But I'm a pacifist.
^3bc11a3e-8f99-4c94-a011-25f85fef229a
^I'll hide behind this!
^634adc3c-6145-40b7-b64d-16745d2871b2
^Like looking in a mirror!
^19afe92c-f4dc-42a6-a194-b3679ccf5cd1
^If I stand directly in front of it, hopefully she won't see me...
^de5c87bb-a554-499c-aa04-42b932af1898
^I'm not going in there without a damn good reason!
^fd47eb4d-7134-42fc-bdb2-5b981efb818a
^I can hide in there! At least I hope I don't end up stabbing myself...
^7dbc2df0-44b5-480f-99fa-bfdb6bbeb436
^Empty.
^7f9d0bc9-f6e3-4d65-af4a-c425a321c758
^I'm not touching that again!
^c3311379-9e1a-4764-a5eb-3445894719d9
^Got you!
^ac681f5a-298b-4863-9d11-2fd50dc7f7c9
^I can't reach that.
^98366787-2b34-4274-9cf3-95628b82c8f5
^Got it!
^2c2f6b6a-5583-45a0-9047-4608588bf326
^I always drink coffee when I search a submarine!
^85fbd71e-ff69-41f0-bfda-b7817d47bf04
^Everyone here knows that!
^1bdac470-cb13-4939-a036-70486864c123
^But I'm not going to drink one now.
^fd836729-23ab-4e6a-b8e7-0711a53c8339
^Not now. I can't leave here without the keystone.
^68fb6676-f0f7-4280-b22a-42dbfc83eaf8
^Unbelievable! I have a real stalker! She's recorded all kinds of things about me!
^d367fc43-917e-415c-94e8-296013c987a5
^That must lead to other areas of the submarine.
^72874a14-696a-459e-836a-a059e53cac14
^Or maybe there's a back door?
^88e7e1b9-aebc-42b9-b198-f46fb2ab4e02
^Larry, I don't think submarines work that way.
^1a05e49a-54d4-4b3e-b54e-a517e8107110
^That's where Yanmei went...
^aa7193b7-246d-4568-ac90-ca4d4885b189
^Hm. I wonder what the F stands for?
